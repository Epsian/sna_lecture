A method to look at relational data.

Rather than looking only at attributes of specific data points, we are looking at the connections between data.

IN SNA, data points are called **nodes**, and the connections between them are called **edges**.

These components create a **network**, defined by [Wasserman & Faust (1994)](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/sociology/sociology-general-interest/social-network-analysis-methods-and-applications?format=PB) as "finite set or sets of actors and the relation or relations defined on them."

???

One of the first instances of SNA was originally published in 1932 in Jacob Moreno's "Who Shall Survive"

Focused on runaway girls at a correctional school, and how their associations could predict running away more than any attributes of the individual children.

Since then, networks have been used in the social sciences, but only really picked up as the tools to understand SNA became more available.

Neuroscientists use networks (or graphs) to study the brain

useful for understanding how neurons and neuron clusters work

Chemistry was quick to see the use, as early at 1985 seeing the similarities between molocules and networks
